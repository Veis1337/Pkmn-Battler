# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

User will be able to log in to their profile (Mongo/mongoose)
User will have a username, unique ID (OAuth2), and win/loss record
User will have a Current Team - Stays active until you lose.

In order to battle, user will have to pick a randomized team of pokemon.
They will have the option to pick from 1 of 3 randomized pokemon for each slot on their team.

Enemy players will be randomly generated using Random User AI (https://randomuser.me/) + PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)
(Boss enemy players ever 3 wins???)

For each pokemon, their Name, Type, Image, and Base Stats will be pulled from the API.
Combat will be based off of Stat total, with a bonus if Type Advantage. 
Pokemon combat - Each pokemon rolls their Base Stat +/- 30% and subtracts it from the enemy's Base Stat Total.
                - Type of attack is randomized (Tyranitar would have 50% chance of using Rock attack, 50% chance of Dark)
                - 30% damage bonus to super effective attack, 30% damage penalty to not very effective attack
